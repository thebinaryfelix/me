## Features

### ðŸŒŽ Internationalization (i18n) Routing

Using native resources from Next.js the website is available in multiple languages!

Examples:

- To view the website in Portuguese, just visit `https://thebinaryfelix.vercel.app/pt`
- To view it in English, go to: `https://thebinaryfelix.vercel.app/en`

Supported languages:

- ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ English: `/en`
- ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· Portuguese: `/pt`
- ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¸ Spanish: `/en`

Want to contribute by adding a new language? Follow the steps below:

1. Fork the repository
2. Go to `src/dictionaries`
3. Copy one of the JSON files and translate the values (by yourself or using ChatGPT)
4. Create a new file inside `src/dictionaries` using the base [UTS Locale Identifiers](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-59/tr35.html#Identifiers). i.e.: For Portuguese would just be `pt.json`, no need for `pt-BR` or `pt-PT`
5. Go to `src/i18n-config.ts` and add the new language to the `i18n.locales` array
6. Import the new file in `src/getDictionary.ts`
7. Open a pull request with the new file
